This mod has two installation options: manual and through Fusion Overloader system.

Manual Installation
All files needs to be dragged and dropped with replacement, path to each file is made with folders. Yes, this installation is long and boring, but there is Fusion Overloader one.

Installation through Fusion Overloader
Use this method if you have installed Fusion Fix mod.
Installation method is very simple, just drop "update" folder into the game folder and that's all you need to do, start your game and check if mod is working.

"Update 1.90" folder contains only files from update. If you are installing this mod for the first time, then do not touch that folder, files from there are already included in all installations.
If you have installed mod manually before, then install files from this folder to save time.

As for the "Optional Content" folder, you can find all information about it on the main page of the mod.

Mod version - 1.90
