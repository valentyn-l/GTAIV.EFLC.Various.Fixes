## Beta Content

Some beta content makes sense to be restored rather than replaced, not going to explain every change, but there are reasons for them.

- Restored unused Feltzer ad in airport.
- Restored beta roof texture on Woodfellas warehouse in East Hook.
- Restored unused shop signs in Hove Beach.
- Restored unused painting texture in Playboy X apartment (which was reused in TBoGT, but anyway).
- Restored beta Drusilla's look, it makes more sense because of these reasons:
  - Waitresses became visible.
  - Windows from interior correspond the ones from exterior.
  - Fixes double entry door.
  - Corresponds all in-game photos of this place.
