## Optional Content

#### Pedestrian traffic lights
- PC - vanilla, non-functional traffic lights.
- PS3&X360 - fake imitation of functional traffic lights, basically it’s just a painted texture.
- Functional (done by [brokensymmetry](https://gtaforums.com/profile/1187609-brokensymmetry/) - this is how it should have worked from the start, this option may look awesome but unfortunately it has some minor bugs, but hey at least traffic lights now works properly.

#### Fixed misspelled ruZZian text
- Done by request but still not finished.
- For most players this will not make a big difference, but for russian ones like me this fix may be somewhat useful.

#### Billboards from Chinatown Wars by [Ash_735](https://gtaforums.com/profile/129346-ash_735/)
- It has nothing to do with fixes, but it may be considered as little improvement that the mod itself includes.
- What's this thing about is it restores some exclusive billboards from Chinatown Wars, and places them like in CTW respectively, at least that was the idea, but when it came to placing these billboards in game I had to change plans and start looking for other places where it may be suitable to add them there.
- Anyway, if you want to add a little variety to billboards in the game, then this is for you.
