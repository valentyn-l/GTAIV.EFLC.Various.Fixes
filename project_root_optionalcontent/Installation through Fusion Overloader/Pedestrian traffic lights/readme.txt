Since there are several mods that affect lampposts, I cannot know which one of them will have the highest priority in Fusion Overloader, so the only way to install it is manually.
For PC and PS3&X360 options you just need to drag and drop ny_lamp_biggreen.wtd and ny_lamp_chrm_pedx.wtd files in .img archive that have the highest priority.
For Functional option you need to drop the update folder in your game folder.
